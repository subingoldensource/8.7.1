3 Overview - Exception Management
=================================

Exception Management refers to the process of resolving errors generated by the data loads you process with GoldenSource.

The term Exception can be understood as an exception to a rule, although it is usually (and correctly) understood to be synonymous with error. When an incoming data record or element cannot be processed successfully by a component of the GoldenSource system, an error occurs and an exception is logged. Exception Management describes the process of viewing, investigating and manually repairing the data defects that caused the processing errors.

Exceptions can be raised by a wide variety of data defects and configuration errors, but the vast majority of those that occur in production occur for one of the four reasons:

1.  One or more elements in the incoming data record are defective.
2.  One or more elements in the incoming data record are missing.
3.  Domain values or other fixed-set codes are present in the incoming record but are not present in the GoldenSource Datamodel. (This usually occurs when a data vendor adds a code to its feed files and an update has not yet been applied to the associated GoldenSource code set.)
4.  An incoming record points to multiple records in the database.

Exceptions vary in terms of severity. The level of severity of a given exception determines how the system will react to the exception:

*   Fatal Errors cause the entire data record to be rejected.
*   Errors cause a portion of the record to be rejected but allow the non-defective portion to be processed.
*   Warnings notify exception managers of a condition they may want to investigate but do not cause any data rejection.
*   Infos simply log information about conditions with very low severity.

The GoldenSource Workstation User Interface provides a link under **Exception Management**. This points to a group of links that link to different EM functions and tools:

*   Load Error Report
*   Transactions & Exceptions
*   EOI for Exceptions
*   Prioritize Exceptions

3.1 User Interface for Exception Processing
-------------------------------------------

The Exception Management menu on the Workstation user interface consists of the following options:

*   **Load Error Report:** View status and statistics of data loads.
*   **Transactions & Exceptions:** View and manage exceptions.
*   **EOI for Exceptions:** Define Entity of Exceptions (EOI) for the following entities: Issue, Issuer, Financial Market, Financial Institution, Financial Institution Role, Customer, Employee, Account, Dealer Branch, Dealer Representative, and Benchmark.
*   **Prioritize Exceptions:** Prioritize exceptions based on parameters, such as severity, data source, entity, exception type and notification.

### 3.1.1 Load Error Report

The Load Error Report screen allows you to view the load statistics at a glance. This includes batch load activity for a specified period and filtering by load types. It also provides status and statistics of the following data loads into the system:

*   Request/Reply loads
*   FTP task downloads
*   Simple file loads

#### 3.1.1.1 Viewing Load Statistics

Perform the following steps to view the load statistics:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1). The Product Selection menu appears.
2.  Point to **Exception Management** and click **Load Error Report**. The **Load Error Report** search screen appears.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28908-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)
3.  Enter or select the search criteria. The resulting records appear. This data can also be exported to Excel. For example, you can view only the loads that occurred during a specific time period, such as from April 01, 2017 to May 02, 2017. You can search for an exception based on the following search criteria:  
    •    Data Source  
    •    Job Input Information  
    •    Job Status  
    •    Total Tasks  
    •    Completed Tasks  
    •    Successful Tasks Count  
    •    Failed  
    •    Partially Failed  
    •    Filtered Task Count  
    •    Job Start Date/time  
    •    Job End Date/Time  
    •    Job Time  
    •    Job Config Information
4.  Double-click to open a record. The data on this page can also be exported to Excel.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28910-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)

### 3.1.2 Transactions & Exceptions

This screen allows you to access the exceptions, research exceptions, and to take actions on the exceptions. Exceptions are linked to entities, such as Institution, Instrument, Market, Issuer, or Financial Institution. Separate screens have been created to manage these exceptions.

The following table lists the notification status of an exception:

Notification Status

Description

NEW

This is the initial status given when the transaction is generated.

OPENED

This status is manually selected, when the exceptions for a transaction have been viewed but are not handled.

CLOSED

This status is manually selected, generally when no handling is needed. When a  
transaction is marked CLOSED, the transaction cannot be resubmitted nor can the status be reset. Consider closing an exception if it is an Exception as per the system, but not as per the user.

AUTOCLOSED

This is the initial status set for web-based transactions.

REPAIRED

This status is manually selected, after an exception is repaired.

#### 3.1.2.1 Viewing Entity-level Exceptions

Perform the following steps to view the entity-level exceptions:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.
2.  Point to **Exception Management** and click **Transactions & Exceptions**. The **Transactions & Exceptions** search screen appears.
3.  Select an entity from the **Entity** drop-down list to view the entity-level exceptions.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28912-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)
4.  For example, if you select the **Instrument Exception** entity, the following screen appears:  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28913-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)  
    •    To sort by any column in the display, click the column header.  
    •    For additional details, select the required exception by right-clicking it, and then selecting **Open Details**.

#### 3.1.2.2 Viewing Exception Details

Perform the following steps to view the exception details:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.
2.  Point to **Exception Management** and click **Transactions & Exceptions**. The **Transactions & Exceptions** search screen appears.
3.  Select an entity from the **Entity** drop-down list to view the entity-level exceptions.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28912-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
4.  Double-click an exception to view its details.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28914-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)

This screen includes the complete notification text for the exception. This is useful when two records share the same notification ID, but the notification text and resolution are different. This screen also shows all exceptions associated with an entity and indicates, if they are participants in a group.  
To change the status of an exception, select an appropriate value from the Notification Status drop-down box. While a transaction may have more than one exception, the overall Exception Status is maintained at the transaction level.

#### 3.1.2.3 Closing an Exception

This status is manually selected, generally when no exception handling is required. You can consider closing an exception if the problem stated in the exception is no longer valid, and the underlying problem is already resolved. When a transaction is marked as CLOSED, the transaction cannot be resubmitted nor can the status be reset.

Perform the following steps to close an exception:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.
2.  Point to **Exception Management** and click **Transactions & Exceptions**. The **Transactions & Exceptions** search screen appears.
3.  Select an entity from the **Entity** drop-down list to view the entity-level exceptions.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28912-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
4.  Right-click an exception and click **Close**. You can also select multiple rows to perform this action on multiple exceptions.
5.  To view the exception details before closing it, double-click an exception.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28914-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
6.  Click the **Close** button to close the exception. The **CloseExceptions Event is Raised** message appears.

#### 3.1.2.4 Repairing an Exception

An exception with status as ‘Repair’ indicates that some action has been taken for the selected exception record, either by fixing it from the backend, or by loading a new file, or through other corrective action.

The ‘Repair’ button only changes the status of the exception and doesn’t take any action on it.

Perform the following steps to close an exception:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.
2.  Point to **Exception Management** and click **Transactions & Exceptions**. The **Transactions & Exceptions** search screen appears.
3.  Select an entity from the **Entity** drop-down list to view the entity-level exceptions.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28912-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
4.  Right-click an exception and click **Repair**. You can also select multiple rows to perform this action on multiple exceptions.
5.  To view the exception details before repairing it, double-click an exception.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28914-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
6.  Click the **Repair** button to repair the exception. The **RepairExceptions Event is Raised** message appears.

#### 3.1.2.5 Resubmitting an Exception

You can resubmit an exception, if reprocessing the record can resolve the exception. For example, if an exception has been raised for a missing domain value. As a corrective action, you can add the domain value and resubmit the exception. The record is resubmitted to the Reference Engine for processing and the exception is resolved.

If an entity has one or more exceptions, the user can choose to resubmit all exceptions, or selective exceptions for an entity. Internally, a single message is submitted to the processing engine. For example, if an instrument has five exceptions from a vendor record, and the user selects to resubmit all five exceptions, a single message will be submitted for processing. This is because the underlying input message, which has generated these five exceptions is the same.

Perform the following steps to resubmit an exception:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.

4.  Right-click an exception and click **Resubmit**. You can also select multiple rows to perform this action on multiple exceptions.
5.  To view the exception details before resubmitting it, double-click an exception.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28914-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
6.  Click the **Resubmit** button to resubmit the exception. The **ResubmitExceptions Event is Raised** message appears.

#### 3.1.2.6 Reassigning an Exception

Perform the following steps to reassign an exception:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.
2.  Point to **Exception Management** and click **Transactions & Exceptions**. The **Transactions & Exceptions** search screen appears.
3.  Select an entity from the **Entity** drop-down list to view the entity-level exceptions.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28912-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default)
4.  Right-click an exception and click **Re-Assign**. The **Re-Assign** dialog box appears. You can also select multiple rows to perform this action on multiple exceptions.

3.  Enter the search criteria and click the **Search** button. The results are displayed in the Results table.
4.  Double-click the entity to view its details.
5.  Click **Delete**.

### 3.1.4 Prioritize Exceptions

The Prioritize Exceptions screen allows you to assign a priority value to exceptions based on your risk and severity assessments. You can prioritize exceptions based on a set of parameters that include  
exception type, notification ID, vendor, severity, or the main table affected, while setting one or more criteria at a time.  
The priority of an exception is defined by base priority points.

*   0 - 4: Low
*   5 – 8: Medium
*   9 – 12: High
*   Above 12: Urgent

Administrators can set exception priorities based on the following key parameters:

*   **Notification ID:** Select a notification ID via the Application ID field. When you set this parameter, key fields fill in automatically.
*   **Data Source:** Select the targeted vendor from the drop-down.
*   **Load Name:** Select the targeted MDX file from the dropdown.
*   **Severity:** Select one of the following values: Fatal, Error, Warning, Informational, and Success.
*   **Exception Type:** Select the exception type.
*   **Entity Type:** Select the entity type from a drop-down of table names.

An exception may also have different priority settings, so the maximum priority found is used in such cases. Let us consider the following example,

*   Priority is set to HIGH where Severity = Fatal Error
*   Priority is set to URGENT where Severity = Fatal Error and Data Source = Bloomberg

In this example, if a transaction has a fatal error then generally the exception will be assigned a HIGH priority. However, if the fatal error is thrown for a Bloomberg transaction, it will be given an URGENT priority.  
The recommended approach is to assign the minimum priority for a severity, and then increment the priority for an exception based on other parameters. In the base product, the following priority settings are defined, which can be customized based on customer preferences:

Severity

Priority

Base Points

Fatal

High

10

Error

Medium

5

Warning

Low

1

Information

Low

0

Successful

Low

0

#### 3.1.4.1 Assigning Priority to Exceptions

Exceptions can be prioritized depending on their criticality, time sensitivity and financial risk. For example, since corporate actions are generally considered more serious, you can assign an URGENT priority to such exceptions.  
Perform the following steps to assign priority to exceptions:

1.  From the Landing page, click  ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/28907-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=V_8_7_0_01REL&language=default). The Product Selection menu appears.

3.  Click **Search**.
4.  Double-click a record to access it. The **Speed** screen for setting the priority of exceptions appears.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/29001-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)
5.  Click the **Lookup** icon and search for the application ID. The application ID and its corresponding fields are populated on the screen.  
    ![](http://indoc01:8888/exceptionmanagement/29002-GSC/version/live/part/ImageData/data?branch=392&language=1)
6.  Change the **Data Source**, **Entity Type,** and **Base Priority Points** to define its priority. For example, to flag Corporate Actions exceptions pertaining to the data received from Bloomberg as URGENT priority, select the following options:

*   **Data Source:** Bloomberg
*   **Entity Type:** Corporate Actions
*   **Base Priority Points:** 13

8.  Click **Save Changes**.

### 3.1.5 Requesting Data from Vendor
